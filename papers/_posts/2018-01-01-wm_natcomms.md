# Abstract

Competing accounts propose that working memory (WM) is subserved either by persistent
activity in single neurons or by dynamic (time-varying) activity across a neural population.
Here, we compare these hypotheses across four regions of prefrontal cortex (PFC) in an
oculomotor-delayed-response task, where an intervening cue indicated the reward available
for a correct saccade. WM representations were strongest in ventrolateral PFC neurons with
higher intrinsic temporal stability (time-constant). At the population-level, although a stable
mnemonic state was reached during the delay, this tuning geometry was reversed relative to
cue-period selectivity, and was disrupted by the reward cue. Single-neuron analysis revealed
many neurons switched to coding reward, rather than maintaining task-relevant spatial
selectivity until saccade. These results imply WM is fulfilled by dynamic, population-level
activity within high time-constant neurons. Rather than persistent activity supporting stable
mnemonic representations that bridge subsequent salient stimuli, PFC neurons may stabilise
a dynamic population-level process supporting WM.
