# Abstract

Naturalistic decision-making typically involves sequential deployment of attention to choice alternatives to gather information
before a decision is made. Attention filters how information enters decision circuits, thus implying that attentional control may
shape how decision computations unfold. We recorded neuronal activity from three subregions of the prefrontal cortex (PFC)
while monkeys performed an attention-guided decision-making task. From the first saccade to decision-relevant information,
a triple dissociation of decision- and attention-related computations emerged in parallel across PFC subregions. During subsequent saccades, orbitofrontal cortex activity reflected the value comparison between currently and previously attended information. In contrast, the anterior cingulate cortex carried several signals reflecting belief updating in light of newly attended
information, the integration of evidence to a decision bound and an emerging plan for what action to choose. Our findings show
how anatomically dissociable PFC representations evolve during attention-guided information search, supporting computations critical for value-guided choice.
