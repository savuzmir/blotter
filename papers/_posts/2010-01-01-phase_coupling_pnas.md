# Abstract

Hebb proposed that neuronal cell assemblies are critical for effective
perception, cognition, and action. However, evidence for brain mechanisms that coordinate multiple coactive assemblies remains lacking.
Neuronal oscillations have been suggested as one possible mechanism for cell assembly coordination. Prior studies have shown that
spike timing depends upon local field potential (LFP) phase proximal
to the cell body, but few studies have examined the dependence of
spiking on distal LFP phases in other brain areas far from the neuron
or the influence of LFP–LFP phase coupling between distal areas on
spiking. We investigated these interactions by recording LFPs and
single-unit activity using multiple microelectrode arrays in several
brain areas and then used a unique probabilistic multivariate phase
distribution to model the dependence of spike timing on the full
pattern of proximal LFP phases, distal LFP phases, and LFP–LFP phase
coupling between electrodes. Here we show that spiking activity
in single neurons and neuronal ensembles depends on dynamic
patterns of oscillatory phase coupling between multiple brain
areas, in addition to the effects of proximal LFP phase. Neurons that
prefer similar patterns of phase coupling exhibit similar changes in
spike rates, whereas neurons with different preferences show divergent responses, providing a basic mechanism to bind different neurons together into coordinated cell assemblies. Surprisingly, phasecoupling–based rate correlations are independent of interneuron distance. Phase-coupling preferences correlate with behavior and neural
function and remain stable over multiple days. These findings suggest
that neuronal oscillations enable selective and dynamic control of
distributed functional cell assemblies
