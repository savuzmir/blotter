# Abstract

Damage to prefrontal cortex (PFC) impairs decision-making, but the underlying value computations that might cause such
impairments remain unclear. Here we report that value computations are doubly dissociable among PFC neurons. Although
many PFC neurons encoded chosen value, they used opponent encoding schemes such that averaging the neuronal population
extinguished value coding. However, a special population of neurons in anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), but not in orbitofrontal
cortex (OFC), multiplexed chosen value across decision parameters using a unified encoding scheme and encoded reward
prediction errors. In contrast, neurons in OFC, but not ACC, encoded chosen value relative to the recent history of choice values.
Together, these results suggest complementary valuation processes across PFC areas: OFC neurons dynamically evaluate current
choices relative to recent choice values, whereas ACC neurons encode choice predictions and prediction errors using a common
valuation currency reflecting the integration of multiple decision parameters.
