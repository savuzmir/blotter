# Abstract

Neurons encode upcoming rewards throughout frontal cortex.
Recent papers have helped to determine that these signals play
different roles in different frontal regions. Neurons in
orbitofrontal cortex (PFo) appear to be responsible for
calculating the specific value of an expected reward,
information that can help efficiently guide decision-making.
Similar signals are also present in the cingulate sulcus (PFcs).
By contrast, reward signals in lateral prefrontal cortex (PFl) are
consistent with a role in using reward to guide other cognitive
processes, such as the allocation of attentional resources and
using value information to guide learning other relationships in
the environment such as arbitrary stimulusâ€“response
mappings. A remaining issue for future work is to specify the
precise roles of PFo and PFcs. These two areas show very
different patterns of connectivity with other brain areas, and it
is currently unclear how this effects their contribution to
decision-making.
