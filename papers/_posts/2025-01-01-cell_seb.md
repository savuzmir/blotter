# Abstract

The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is crucial for economic decision-making. However, how PFC value representations facilitate flexible decisions remains unknown. We reframe economic decision-making as a navigation process through a cognitive map of choice values. We found rhesus macaques represented choices as navigation trajectories in a value space using a grid-like code. This occurred in ventromedial PFC (vmPFC) local field potential theta frequency across two datasets. vmPFC neurons deployed the same grid-like code and encoded chosen value. However, both signals depended on theta phase: occurring on theta troughs but on separate theta cycles. Finally, we found sharp-wave ripples—a key signature of planning and flexible behavior—in vmPFC. Thus, vmPFC utilizes cognitive map-based computations to organize and compare values, suggesting an alternative architecture for economic choice in PFC.
