# Abstract

The medial surface of the brainâ€™s frontal lobe has been implicated both
in the voluntary initiation of action and in monitoring actions in
situations where several conflicting responses are possible. Recent
work casts light on how these functions are parcelled out in the medial
frontal cortex.
