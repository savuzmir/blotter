# Abstract

& A central question in behavioral science is how we select
among choice alternatives to obtain consistently the most
beneficial outcomes. Three variables are particularly important
when making a decision: the potential payoff, the probability
of success, and the cost in terms of time and effort. A key
brain region in decision making is the frontal cortex as damage
here impairs the ability to make optimal choices across a range
of decision types. We simultaneously recorded the activity of
multiple single neurons in the frontal cortex while subjects
made choices involving the three aforementioned decision
variables. This enabled us to contrast the relative contribution
of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), the orbito-frontal cortex, and the lateral prefrontal cortex to the decision-making
process. Neurons in all three areas encoded value relating to
choices involving probability, payoff, or cost manipulations.
However, the most significant signals were in the ACC, where
neurons encoded multiplexed representations of the three
different decision variables. This supports the notion that the
ACC is an important component of the neural circuitry underlying optimal decision making.
