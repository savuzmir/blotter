# Abstract

Integrating costs and benefits is crucial for optimal decision-making. Although much is known about decisions that involve outcomerelated costs (e.g., delay, risk), many of our choices are attached to actions and require an evaluation of the associated motor costs. Yet
how the brain incorporates motor costs into choices remains largely unclear. We used human fMRI during choices involving monetary
reward and physical effort to identify brain regions that serve as a choice comparator for effort-reward trade-offs. By independently
varying both options’ effort and reward levels, we were able to identify the neural signature of a comparator mechanism. A network
involving supplementary motor area and the caudal portion of dorsal anterior cingulate cortex encoded the difference in reward (positively) and effort levels (negatively) between chosen and unchosen choice options. We next modeled effort-discounted subjective values
using a novel behavioral model. This revealed that the same network of regions involving dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and supplementary motor area encoded the difference between the chosen and unchosen options’ subjective values, and that activity was best
described using a concave model of effort-discounting. In addition, this signal reflected how precisely value determined participants’
choices. By contrast, separate signals in supplementary motor area and ventromedial prefrontal cortex correlated with participants’
tendency to avoid effort and seek reward, respectively. This suggests that the critical neural signature of decision-making for choices
involving motor costs isfound in human cingulate cortex and not ventromedial prefrontal cortex astypically reportedfor outcome-based
choice. Furthermore, distinct frontal circuits seem to drive behavior toward reward maximization and effort minimization.
