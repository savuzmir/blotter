# Abstract

Relations between task elements often follow hidden underlying structural forms such as
periodicities or hierarchies, whose inferences fosters performance. However, transferring
structural knowledge to novel environments requires flexible representations that are
generalizable over particularities of the current environment, such as its stimuli and size.
We suggest that humans represent structural forms as abstract basis sets and that in novel
tasks, the structural form is inferred and the relevant basis set is transferred. Using a computational model, we show that such representation allows inference of the underlying
structural form, important task states, effective behavioural policies and the existence of
unobserved state-trajectories. In two experiments, participants learned three abstract graphs
during two successive days. We tested how structural knowledge acquired on Day-1 affected
Day-2 performance. In line with our model, participants who had a correct structural
prior were able to infer the existence of unobserved state-trajectories and appropriate
behavioural policies.
