# Abstract
Rhythmic bimanual movements are highly constrained in the temporal domain, with the gestures of
the two hands tightly synchronized. Previous studies have implicated a subcortical locus for
temporal coupling based on the observation that these constraints persist in callosotomy patients.
We now report that such coupling is restricted to movements entailing a discrete event (such as a
movement onset). Three callosotomy patients exhibited a striking lack of temporal coupling during
continuous movements, with the two hands oscillating at non-identical frequencies. We propose a
subcortical locus of temporal coupling for movements involving discrete events. In contrast,
synchronization between the hands during continuous movements depends on interhemispheric
transmission across the corpus callosum.
