# Abstract

Simultaneous reaching movements made with
the two hands can show a considerable increase in reaction time (RT) when they differ in terms of direction
or extent, compared to when the movements involve the
same direction and extent. This cost has been attributed
to cross-talk in the specification of the motor parameters
for the two hands. However, a recent study [Diedrichsen, Hazeltine, Kennerley, & Ivry, (2001). Psychological
Science, 12, 493â€“498] indicates that when reaching
movements are cued by the onset of the target endpoint,
no compatibility effects are observed. To determine why
directly cued movements are immune from interference,
we varied the stimulus onset asynchrony for the two
movements and used different combinations of directly
cued and symbolically cued movements. In two experiments, compatibility effects were only observed when
both movements were symbolically cued. No difference
was found between compatible and incompatible
movements when both movements were directly cued or
when one was directly cued and the other was symbolically cued. These results indicate that interference is not
related to the specification of movement parameters but
instead emerges from processes associated with response
selection. Moreover, the data suggest that cross-talk,
when present, primarily shortens the RT of the second
movement on compatible trials rather than lengthening
this RT on incompatible trials.
