# Abstract

Four experiments were conducted to identify the locus of interference observed during the preparation of
bimanual reaching movements. Target locations were specified by color, and the right-hand and left-hand
targets could be either the same or a different color. Movements of different amplitudes (Experiment 1)
or different directions (Experiment 2) to targets of the same color were initiated more quickly than
symmetric movements to targets of different colors. These results indicate that costs observed during
bimanual movements arise during target selection rather than during motor programming. Experiments
3 and 4 further examined the interference associated with target selection. Reaction time costs were found
with unimanual movements when the target was presented among distractors associated with responses
for the other hand. Interference observed during bimanual reaching appears to reflect difficulty in
segregating the response rules assigned to each hand.
