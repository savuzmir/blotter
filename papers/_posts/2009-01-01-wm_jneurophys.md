# Abstract

Several lines of
research indicate that emotional and motivational information may be
useful in guiding the allocation of attentional resources. Two areas of
the frontal lobe that are particularly implicated in the encoding of
motivational information are the orbital prefrontal cortex (PFo) and
the dorsomedial region of prefrontal cortex, specifically the anterior
cingulate sulcus (PFcs). However, it remains unclear whether these
areas use this information to influence spatial attention. We used
single-unit neurophysiology to examine whether, at the level of
individual neurons, there was evidence for integration between reward
information and spatial attention. We trained two subjects to perform
a task that required them to attend to a spatial location across a delay
under different expectancies of reward for correct performance. We
balanced the order of presentation of spatial and reward information
so we could assess the neuronal encoding of the two pieces of
information independently and conjointly. We found little evidence
for encoding of the spatial location in either PFo or PFcs. In contrast,
both areas encoded the expected reward. Furthermore, PFo consistently encoded reward more quickly than PFcs, although reward
encoding was subsequently more prevalent and stronger in PFcs.
These results suggest a differential contribution of PFo and PFcs to
reward encoding, with PFo potentially more important for initially
determining the value of rewards predicted by sensory stimuli. They
also suggest that neither PFo nor PFcs play a direct role in the control
of spatial attention.
