# Abstract

How does the brain evaluate whether the benefits of a decision outweigh the costs? A study now reveals that neurons
in the anterior cingulate cortex encode costs and benefits, and altering brain activity here biases choices away from
negative outcomes. These results link anterior cingulate cortex with the regulation of emotional states.
