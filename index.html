			Decision-making is one of the most important cognitive functions of humans and animals. 
			We make hundreds of decisions every day, from the seemingly simple (e.g., what to eat for lunch) to the more complex (e.g., how to best allocate your time). 
			Most of these decisions will be associated with their own costs and benefits (reward, time, probability, effort, etc) which collectively need 
			evaluation and integration to determine each choiceâ€™s overall value. However, that is only one side of the story. 
		</p>
		<p>
			When making decisions, it is beneficial to have a model of the environment within which choices are made. 
			For example, knowing the rules or structure of the environment (e.g., knowing the layout of the London transport system) is useful if the environment 
			changes and our behaviour needs to be adjusted (e.g., when your commuter bus/train line is down) to achieve the desired goal (e.g. getting to work).
			Understanding the possible rules and transitions is also useful for simulating or predicting the necessary behaviour in new environments with
			similar structure (e.g., applying rules/concepts from the London Underground when using the Paris Underground). 
		</p>

		<p>
			Thus, arguably the main function of the brain and its many cognitive functions (memory, learning, attention) is to support learning 
			appropriate neural models that underlie optimal behavior. 
		</p>
		<p>
			The goal of our lab is to uncover what role regions across the prefrontal cortex, in particular the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), 
			anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC), and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), 
			play in representing such neural  models that are employed when we make choices.  
		</p>
			Our working philosophy is that to understand behavior in both health and disease, we must understand the anatomical networks 
			and neural computations/mechanisms that support behavior. 
			To accomplish this, we use a range of methodological approaches including electrophysiology (single neuron, local field potentials), 
			human neuroimaging (fMRI, MEG), and biophysical and computational modeling. 
			We also test causal links between these brain regions and behavior by using reversible inactivation (pharmacological or stimulation) techniques.
